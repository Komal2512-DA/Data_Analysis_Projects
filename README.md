#  ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to My Data Analysis Portfolio

Hi there! I'm Komal, and this is my personal Data Analysis portfolio - a space where I share my projects, learning journey, and insights discovered through data. ðŸ“Šâœ¨

I love exploring datasets, cleaning and preparing them, analyzing trends, and building meaningful visualizations that tell a story. My goal is to transform raw data into actionable insights and provide data-driven recommendations. ðŸš€

### ðŸ§  What You'll Find Here:

* âœ… End-to-end Data Analysis projects (from data cleaning -> EDA -> visualization -> insights -> recommendations)
* âœ… Step-by-step breakdowns of analytical approaches
* âœ… Visual storytelling with charts & dashboards
* âœ… Case studies on solving real-world business problems

Iâ€™m excited to keep learning, experimenting, and sharing my work with the community. Letâ€™s turn data into decisions! ðŸ’¡
